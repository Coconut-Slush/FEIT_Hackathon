============================
Example 1: Hi, I'm Alex, can I order 2 wines like last time?
----------------------------
Since you mentioned 'last time', I've checked on the exact wine you previously purchased, which is the Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa) 2021. Fortunately, we have 8 units of this dry red wine available in stock, which is more than the 2 units you are looking to purchase. Therefore, I recommend proceeding with your purchase of the Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa) 2021.

============================
Example 2: Alex here — please send me 3 bubbly bottles again.
----------------------------
Since you mentioned 'last time', I will prioritize the exact last-SKU, which is Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa) 2021, a dry red wine. Fortunately, we have 8 units of this wine available in stock, which is more than the 3 units you are looking to purchase. I recommend proceeding with the purchase of Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa) 2021, as we have sufficient stock to fulfill your request.

============================
Example 3: Hello, this is David. I'd like 2 Syrah from last time.
----------------------------
David, you're looking to purchase Syrah, which is equivalent in style to Shiraz. Since you last bought Shiraz (McLaren Vale) 2020 on 2025-09-29, I've checked the stock for you. Fortunately, we have sufficient stock of Shiraz (McLaren Vale) 2020, with 3 units available, which is enough to fulfill your request of 2 units. I recommend proceeding with the purchase of Shiraz (McLaren Vale) 2020.

============================
Example 4: Could you ship 1 dry red from Barossa, same as before?
----------------------------
Since you mentioned 'last time', I've checked the availability of the exact wine you had previously, which is the Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa) 2021. Fortunately, we have 8 units of this dry red wine in stock, so I recommend proceeding with the purchase of one unit as requested, ensuring you can enjoy the same wine you had last time.

============================
Example 5: Good afternoon, this is Alex. I’d like 5 bottles of Prosecco again.
----------------------------
Alex, you're looking to purchase Prosecco DOC (Sparkling) NV, but since your last purchase was a different type of wine, I'll check the stock for your requested wine. However, I found that we have a sufficient stock of Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa) 2021, which you purchased recently. Since you're interested in Prosecco DOC (Sparkling) NV, I can confirm that we don't have the exact stock information for this wine, but a similar sparkling wine, Cava Brut (Sparkling) NV, could be a close substitute. Nevertheless, given the sufficient stock of Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa) 2021 and considering you might be looking for a change, if you'd like to proceed with the available Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa) 2021, I can recommend doing so as we have 8 bottles in stock, which is more than your requested 5 bottles.
